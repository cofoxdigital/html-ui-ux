## Building a Complete Website

### Example: Event Registration Website

1. **Landing Page** (Page Builder)
   - Hero section with event details
   - Features grid showing event highlights
   - Registration CTA button

2. **Registration Form** (Form Builder)
   - Personal information fields
   - Ticket selection
   - Payment integration

3. **Registration Workflow** (Workflow Builder)
   - Validate form data
   - Process payment
   - Send confirmation email
   - Route to success page

4. **Dashboard Page** (Page Builder + Widget Builder)
   - Registration statistics widget

5. **Multi-Step Process** (Workflow Builder)
   - Step 1: Personal Info → Step 2: Ticket Selection → Step 3: Payment → Step 4: Confirmation
   - Each step is a separate page with forms
   - Workflow manages the progression and data flow

## Technical Implementation

### Page Structure
```html
<div class="grid-section">
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-row">
      <div class="grid-cell col-6">
        <!-- Form Component -->
      </div>
      <div class="grid-cell col-6">
        <!-- Widget Component -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Workflow Integration
```javascript
// Workflow triggers when form is submitted
workflow.on('form-submit', (data) => {
  // Process data
  // Navigate to next page
  // Update widgets
});
```
